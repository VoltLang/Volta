 * These non-nodes handles the symbol space of nodes.
 * These provide 'mechanism' over 'policy'; how look
 * ups are performed, where they're performed. Parameter
 * shadowing parent Scopes is allowed by these, that
 * error has to come from another layer. The main
 * restriction provided by these classes is that you can't
 * have multiple Stores associated with the same name in
 * a single Scope.
 * 
 * Some passes that deal with context are the Context pass,
 * the DeclGatherer pass, and the ScopeManager pass.
 *
 * In addition most of the semantic passes will lookup
 * things in Scopes.
