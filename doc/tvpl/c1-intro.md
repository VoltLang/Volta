# The Volt Programming Language

Volt is a systems programming language.

It has become increasingly difficult to find a consistent definition of a "systems programming language". So perhaps a better statement would be that Volt is a language that outputs executable code directly, and intends to help the programmer write efficient software in a comfortable environment.

This guide is intended for close reading by beginning programmers, and perhaps a skim from more experienced ones that are curious about the whats and whys of Volt. We hope that it will be of some use to you. If you have a thought on how it could be improved, feel free to open an issue on the [Volta GitHub page](https://github.com/VoltLang/Volta), contact the author [by email](mailto:b.helyer@gmail.com), or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bhelyer).
