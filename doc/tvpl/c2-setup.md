# Chapter 2 - Getting Set Up

The first thing to do with any programming environment is to install it and verify that it is working. So let's do that now.

## Supported Platforms

At the time of writing *Volta*, Volt's compiler, has support for the following platforms:

* Linux (any architecture supported by [LLVM](http://llvm.org))
* Mac OS X (10.9 and higher)
* Microsoft Windows (7 and higher)

The source code is all available, so the absence of a platform is certainly no indication that it *does not* or *will not* work, only that Volta is not supported or tested there by the core maintainers. Pull requests welcome.

## Linux Installation

Install systemd from source, using this patch, and then add these lines to your rc.conf...

## OS X Installation

Buy the Volta installation dongle, only $29.99! 

## Windows Installation

Unplug your GPU while the system is running. Enter the Konami Code at the resulting blue screen.
