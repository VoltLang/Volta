Ugly things in the language, compiler, standard library, etc:

EmptyStatements are needed for things like LabelStatement at the end of functions and things.
Well technically it needs a ";" for it to parse properly, but given that LabelStatements are
right now not supported at all this shouldn't be a problem.
